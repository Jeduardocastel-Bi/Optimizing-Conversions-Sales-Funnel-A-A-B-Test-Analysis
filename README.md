# 👩🧑🍎🛒 8. User Behavior in a Product App  

## 📖 Project Description  
You are working for a startup that sells food products. Your task is to analyze user behavior within the company's app.  

### Goals:  
1. **Sales Funnel Analysis**:  
   - Examine the sales funnel to understand how users move through each stage.  
   - Identify the number of users who complete purchases versus those who drop off.  
   - Pinpoint specific stages where users encounter obstacles.  

2. **A/A/B Test Results Analysis**:  
   - Evaluate an A/A/B test conducted to study the impact of a new font design.  
   - Compare two control groups (old font) and one experimental group (new font).  
   - Confirm the reliability of results by ensuring the control groups behave similarly.  

### Context:  
The A/A/B test aims to decide if changing the font is viable. If the two control groups differ significantly, it may indicate issues affecting test validity. Reliable comparisons help in determining data requirements for future experiments.  

The same dataset is used for general app analysis and the A/A/B test, as real-world experiments continuously assess app quality regardless of experiment participation.
